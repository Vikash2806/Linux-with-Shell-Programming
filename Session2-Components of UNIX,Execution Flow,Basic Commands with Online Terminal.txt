Components of Unix:
--------------------
2 important components:
    Shell
    Kernel

1. Shell:
---------
It is outer layer of unix oeprating system.
Shell reads commands provided by the users.
Shell will check whether is it valid command or not.
Shell will check whether is it properly used or not.
if everything is proper, then shell interprets(converts) that command into kernel understandable format and handover that to the kernel.
Shell acts as interface between user and kernel.

2. Kernel:
----------
It is the core component of UNIX operating system.
It is repsonsible to execute our coomands with the help of Hardware components.

Memory allocation and process allocation will takes care by kernel.
It acts as interface between shell and hardware components.

date -> to display date
cal -> to display calculator

Todo  a big task
-----------------

test.sh file
------------
cal
date
echo "Hello Friends Welcome to unix world!"

after 3 commands => chmod u+x test.sh
multiple commands is runned at the once with the help of shell script i.e. test.sh

4 components hierarchy
----------------------
1. user/applications
2. shell
3. kernel
4. hardware

user/application --> Shell --> Kernel --> Hardware

command execution flow
----------------------
1. end user types a command on the terminal
2. command will be submitted to the shell
3. shell checks whether this command is valid or not and whether it is properly used or not 
    a. if it is not proper display, error message to the terminal

    goes to 6 i.e.
    6. again $ prompt will be display to the terminal,which indicates ready for the next command.

4. if it is proper shell interprets that command into kernel understandable form and handover to the kernel
5. kernel executes that command and perform required action 
6. again $ prompt will be display to the terminal,which indicates ready for the next command.

two typer of users in linux:
1. normal user ==> $ prompt
2. super user/root users/admin user ==> # prompt
