Components of Unix:
--------------------
2 important components:
    Shell
    Kernel

1. Shell:
---------
It is outer layer of unix oeprating system.
Shell reads commands provided by the users.
Shell will check whether is it valid command or not.
Shell will check whether is it properly used or not.
if everything is proper, then shell interprets(converts) that command into kernel understandable format and handover that to the kernel.
Shell acts as interface between user and kernel.

2. Kernel:
----------
It is the core component of UNIX operating system.
It is repsonsible to execute our coomands with the help of Hardware components.

Memory allocation and process allocation will takes care by kernel.
It acts as interface between shell and hardware components.
